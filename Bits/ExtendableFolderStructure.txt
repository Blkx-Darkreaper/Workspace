If a folder consists of 1 block made up of 16 entries, then the folder can store references to 15 files and subfolders with the first entry storing the folder information.

This limit can be eliminated by reserving the last entry for a folder extension entry. This extension entry would hold a reference to another folder. This secondary folder would hold the same parent folder information as the first folder. To load all files within a folder would involve traversing this linked list and loading all non-folder files found along the way
