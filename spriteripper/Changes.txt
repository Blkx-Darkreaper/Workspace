Break large images up into several smaller subimages
For each subimage iterate through all tiles but don't create bitmaps for each tile until a comparison needs to be made, discard all tile bitmaps after use
Once all tiles in a subimage group have been organized and all duplicates discarded move onto the next subimage
When two sorted groups have been created compare and merge the two groups, then continue

Add controls to allow different subimages to be displayed
Add button to GUI to display the end product, place a limit on the max number of tiles in this tileset
